Supported browsers
==================

GlobaLeaks is designed to fully support all commonly used browsers on desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Unfortunately, this browser appears to lack some necessary capabilities.

We recommend using the `Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ for enhanced anonymity, as well as additional privacy and security features that are not available in other browsers.
